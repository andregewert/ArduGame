# ArduGame SSD1306

Implementation of the ArduGame-API which uses the Adafruit SSD1306 library to control a SSD1306 / SSD1309 driven OLED (via ISP) as a display.
This library should be hardware compatible with the 32U4-based Arduboy (you have to configure the right pins, though).

Alternatively, the ArduGame_U8G2 implementation can be used for SSD1306 / SSD1309 display. In addition this library supports many other display types.
