# ArduGame

Simple framework for creating games on the arduino platform

## Supported setups

Currently there are two supported hardware setups:

1. Arduino Nano with RCA / tv signal as display
2. Arduino Nano with OLED SSD1306 / SSD1309

Both setups can be run with one of three controller types:

1. Digital buttons; needs seven pins // TODO link to example board
2. Analog stick with one switch, needs three pins // TODO add link
3. Digital buttons on a single analog pin // TODO add link
